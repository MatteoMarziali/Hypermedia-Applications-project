# MJM Clinic webapp

Development of a Health Clinic web application demo running on a Node.js based server which accesses and queries a Database to get the dynamic content to display. The front-end of the application was developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript (and jQuery) and was previously designed and modeled with IDM notation, lowfidelity wireframes and an interactive Mockup. The application was deployed in Cloud on Heroku (PaaS).
